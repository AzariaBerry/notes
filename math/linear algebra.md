# Linear

## Decision trees and random forests

- Decision tree = a type of flow chart where each node represents a test/choice, and each branch represents the outcome of that test/choice. A decision is made after all tests/choices are done. Example: picking an outfit for the weather and activities you are doing.
- Random forest = a learning method for classification and regression that makes a bunch of decision trees and outputs a list of classes or a mean prediction of the trees. So, its a machine learning method that makes and runs a bunch of decision trees to make decisions.

## 4 assumptions of linear algebra

- Linearity = the relationship between x and y is linear.
- Homoscedasticity = Variance of the residual is the same for any value of x.
- Independence = Observations are independent of each other.
- Normal = for any fixed pair of x,y there is normal distribution.
