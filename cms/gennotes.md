A headless cms breaks apart the frontend and backend so that a dev can make the front end whatever they want
Headless- cms that only contains back-end dev environment not default templating system (a subset of decoupled)
Hybrid-same thing as decoupled may be fully headless but comes with tools and frameworks out of the box to make life easier
Front-end agnostic- doesnâ€™t contain a front-end design platform
What's the difference between decoupled and headless?
Headless is better for multi-channel and when you are comfortable with API driven systems
Headless is better for future-proofing, non-strict design, performance, lack of weird 3rd party stuff
Headed is better when you need an editor, and can lead to a shaky tech stack
