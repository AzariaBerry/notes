# ARIA-> Accessible rich internet applications

Used to make the internet easier to use for things like screen readers, and people who can't use the mouse.

Some screen readers will read bullets or numbers for ordered lists and unordered lists, even if you hide the styling with CSS.

Aria is made of:

- Roles
    - Roles are used for vague elements to give more context. (i.e. status, but the actual element is just a div)
- Properties
    - Add extra meaning/stats. These don't change.
- States
    - Things like "hidden"
