# Compose

- Configure relationships between containers
- Save container settings in yaml
- one liner dev environment start
- made of two things
    - YAML - containers, networks, and volumes
    - CLI tools - docker compose used for local dev/test automation with those yaml files
- not meant for production load
    - up/setup/down down doesn't remove built containers
