Each 3D element with z>0 becomes larger; each 3D-element with z<0 becomes smaller. The strength of the effect is determined by the value of this property.
The transform-style CSS property sets whether children of an element are positioned in the 3D space or are flattened in the plane of the element.
The backface-visibility property defines whether or not the back face of an element should be visible when facing the user.
The back face of an element is a mirror image of the front face being display
