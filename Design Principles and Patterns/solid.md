# SOLID
Single responsibility principle
A class should only have one reason to change
Open/Closed
Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
Liskov Substitution principle
Child classes should never break the parent class' type definitions i.e. subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
Interface Segregation principle
Business logic to clients, no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
Dependency inversion principle
Removing hard-links between discrete classes (! Not like united way) depends on abstractions. No not depend on concretions
