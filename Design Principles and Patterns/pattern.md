# Design Patterns

## Facade Pattern

- An object that serves as a front-facing interface masking a more complex underlying/structural code.
- Used when the subsystems are complex and you want to present a simpler interface + reduced interdependence, or you need an entry point to each layer
- If done correctly itâ€™s easier to understand and test, and more flexible and reusable

## The Observer Pattern

- The observer is a design pattern in which an object maintains a list of objects depending on its observers, automatically notifying them of any changes to the state.

- Mixins and decorators can be used instead of subclassing
