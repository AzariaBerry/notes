# Objects and this

## objects

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

## this

Arrow functions, as part of ES6 syntax, do NOT have their own 'this' keyword. 
Instead, they will use the 'this' keyword of whatever 'this' was outside the function when it was created.
