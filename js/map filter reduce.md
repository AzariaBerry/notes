Map()
The difference is that it returns a new array that replaces each value with the return value of the callback function
Filter()
Creates a new array with things that return true from the function 
Reduce()
It is another method that iterates over each item in the array, but this time it cumulatively combines each result to return just a single value.
The callback function is used to describe how to combine each value of the array with the running total. This is often used for the calculation of data stored in an array.
every()
Reduce array to one result
